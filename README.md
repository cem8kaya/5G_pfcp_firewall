## Prerequisites

Before building the PFCP Firewall, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

### Essential Build Tools
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo yum install cmake git

# macOS
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake
```

### OpenSSL Development Libraries

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install openssl-devel

# macOS
brew install openssl@3
```

## Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pfcp_firewall.git
cd pfcp_firewall
```

2. Create and enter the build directory:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

3. Configure the build:

For Linux:
```bash
cmake ..
```

For macOS (specify OpenSSL path):
```bash
cmake .. -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3
```

4. Build the project:
```bash
make
```

The compiled binary will be available as `./pfcp_firewall` in the build directory.

## Configuration

The firewall uses default configurations that can be modified at runtime:

- Control Plane Port: 8805 (standard PFCP port)
- User Plane Port: 8806
- Maximum Sessions: 10,000
- Queue Size: 1,000
- Session Timeout: 1000ms

## Running the Firewall

After building, you can run the firewall:

```bash
./pfcp_firewall
```

The firewall will start with default settings and create a log file at `pfcp_firewall.log`.

## Development Setup

For development work, you might want to install additional tools:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install clang-format clang-tidy valgrind

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install clang clang-tools-extra valgrind

# macOS
brew install clang-format llvm valgrind
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

1. OpenSSL Not Found (macOS):
```bash
# Solution: Specify OpenSSL path explicitly
cmake .. -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3
```

2. Compilation Errors:
```bash
# Ensure all dependencies are installed
# Check compiler version supports C++17
g++ --version
```

3. Runtime Permission Issues:
```bash
# Allow binding to privileged ports
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep ./pfcp_firewall
```

## Security Considerations

- The firewall must run with appropriate permissions to bind to network ports
- Regular security audits are recommended
- Monitor `pfcp_firewall.log` for security events
- Configure system limits appropriately:

```bash
# Add to /etc/security/limits.conf
* soft nofile 65535
* hard nofile 65535
```
